Generate hard negative examples for water conflict classifier.

Hard negatives are water-related headlines that are NOT conflicts:
- Water infrastructure projects (peaceful)
- Water research and technology
- Water conservation initiatives
- Environmental water topics
- Water policy/regulations (non-violent)

These are critical for preventing false positives where the model
classifies any water-related news as a conflict.
